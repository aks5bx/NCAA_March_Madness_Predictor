# NCAA_March_Madness_Predictor

## Project Overview
An algorithm that predicts the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament. Algorithm designed and implemented in Excel by Samuel Wagner, implemented by Adi Srikanth in python. 

The data used for this project has not been included in order to protect privacy at the request of algorithm owner. However, an HTML file that includes output is included in the repository to show progress (an easy way to open it is to use an online github html previewer). 

The example output included in the HTML file shows round by round predictions for the 2018 NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament. The algorithm correctly predicts the champion (the Villanova Wildcats). 

## Findings
The model performs well, usually around the 80th percentile, with some years performing better than the 90th percentile.
